dependencies for all notebooks

# Core libraries
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
seaborn>=0.11.0

# Machine learning libraries
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to install them inside Google Colab.

1. Go to Google Colab and sign in
2. Create a new notebook and create a code cell
3. Inside the code cell, type the following code:

!pip install [insert library here]>=[insert version here]

An example of this:

!pip install numpy>=1.21.0

If this fails, check your syntax
If this still fails, try installing without the numbers

An example:

!pip install numpy

After all of these dependencies are installed, you are ready to download and open the notebooks from the repository.
